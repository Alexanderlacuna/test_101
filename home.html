See this link to <a href="https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-docs/edit/master/general/brand/aging/home.md">edit</a>.</p><p>For markdown check <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/">the docs</a>. To embed images you can use a link somewhere from the internet or check it into the gn-doc repo and I'll add a link.</p>
